# Server Side Calculator

## Description

I made a calculator that takes in data from the client and does the calculations on the server, making use of ajax POST and GET calls, exibiting the first two elements of CRUD.


//  ✅  two inputs, one submit('='), 'C' clear button, +, -, * /
//  ✅  client POST inputs
//  ✅  server POST inputs
//  ✅  server data structure
//  ✅  History: Array of all previous calculations
//  ✅  server perform math operations
//                  Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
//  ✅  server responds 'OK' 
//  ✅  client GET req
//  ✅  server GET
//  ✅  client update DOM
//  ✅  Clear button


//STRETCH GOALS:
    // ✅  convert interface to normal calc 
          // ✅ number buttons



```npm install -g heroku```

You will need to login from your terminal to use to use the heroku CLI command:
```heroku login```

Create a Heroku Project
Run ```heroku create```

Type ```git remote -v``` to ensure it added successfully. You should see a remote called heroku

Heroku works by creating a new git remote. Just like we can push our repo to Github (origin), we will now be able to push our repo to heroku:
```git push heroku main```

To open your app in a browser:
```heroku open```
